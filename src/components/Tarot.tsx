                            This card refers to an old Zen parable about how a sheep
                            raised a lion cub and he thought he was a sheep until the
                            old lion grabbed him and took him to a pond where he showed
                            him his reflection. Many of us are like this lionâ€”our self-image
                            is formed not from our direct experience, but from the opinions
                            of others.
